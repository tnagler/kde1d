@section what-kde1d What is kde1d?

[kde1d](https://vinecopulib.github.io/kde1d/) is a header-only C++
library for univariate kernel density estimation based on
[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).

Highlights:

* It implements a univariate kernel density estimator that can handle bounded
and discrete data.
* It provides classical kernel density as well as log-linear and log-quadratic
methods.

For mode details on univariate local polynomial
kernel density estimators that can handle bounded and discrete data, see
